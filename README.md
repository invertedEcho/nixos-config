# nixos-config

archived, as i no longer use nixos.

why? because its too cumbersome to use:

- wanna start developing on a new project (especially when youre in a hurry)? have fun setting up a proper flake and fixing all issues that you will have during that process
- wanna run software thats not been packaged for nix yet (which doesnt happen often to be fair)? same as above point
- and many more reasons
- time is a precious resource

also, the main reason i liked nixos because i could just have every software pre-installed and setup. but thats easily achievable with a bash script and stuff like dconf for gnome, or dotfiles
